##### Bio: 

I am originally from Oregon, and attended undergrad at the University of Oregon in Eugene. While there I worked in the Cresko lab for 3 years studying the evolutionary genetics of populations of three-spined stickleback fish from around Oregon. I moved to Bloomington a year before enrolling in the EEB grad program and during that time worked as a lab tech in the Moczek lab, where I am now a second year grad student beginning preliminary work on looking into the evolutionary relationships betwen different <i>Onthophagus</i> beetle species/populations and their microbial associates.  In my free time I enjoy(?) not sleeping while caring for my currently four month old son.
